            Hey! I’m France Laurence Velarde – a third-year BSIT student and a full stack developer based in Cebu. Philippines. I’ve always been drawn to creativity and tech, which is why I’ve found my groove as a (lowkey) dev building projects for myself and other people. I also love making fun and engaging videos for school purposes and more! Lately, I’ve been really into design – from graphic design to UI/UX design, and a little bit of logo design, it’s where I get to turn my ideas into something real that actually help and connect with people. My coding skills are still a work in progress, but I’m super eager to learn and grow more in the tech space. The goal? To blend creativity and tech, and build something awesome and meaningful along the way.
          </p>
          <p>
            I also work across design systems, system architechture, product design, and UX interactions.
